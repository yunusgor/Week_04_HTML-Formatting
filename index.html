        <br>
        <p>
            &#128073; In HTML, for example, the h1 element, which gives the text
            it wraps arount the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary><mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></summary>
        </details>
        <p>
            &#128073; By default, most browser‘s user agent stylsheet will style an h1 
            with a large font size to make it look like a heading 
            (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).
            On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top
            level heading.
        </p>
        <details>
            <summary><mark>Consider the following</mark></summary>
            ho
        </details>
        <p>
            &#8688; This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it
            has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits
            as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right
            HTML element for the right job.
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8688; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated
            and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation
            (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords
                to influence the page‘s search rankings 
                (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a>)

                Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users
                to navigate a page
            </li>
            <li>
                Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching
                through endless divs wirh or without semantic or namespaced classes

            &#11088; SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website
            more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings
        </p>
        <p>
            &#11088; Search engines <b>crawl</b> the web, following links from page to page,
            and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the
            indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely while
            doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among
            the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (<i>for ecommerce and ads</i>) 
        </p>
        <p>
            &#11088; Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines
            keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine
            guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents
