            <p>
                &#128073; In HTML, for example, the <small><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></small> element is a semantic element, which gives the text
                it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary><mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></summary>
                <p><h1>Hello World!</h1></p>
            </details>
            <p>
                &#128073; By default, most browser's user agent stylsheet will style an <small>&lt;h1&gt;</small>
                with a large font size to make it look like a heading 
                (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).
                On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top
                level heading.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary><mark>Consider the following</mark></summary>
                    <div>Hello World!</div>
                    <br>

            <p>
                &#8688; This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it
                has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits
                as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right
                HTML element for the right job.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#8688; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated
                and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation
                (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.

                    Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords
                    to influence the page's search rankings

                    Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users

                <li>
                    Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching
                    through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

                &#11088; SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website
                more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings
            </p>
            <p>
                &#11088; Search engines <b>crawl</b> the web, following links from page to page,
                and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the
                indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when
                doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among
                the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (<i>for ecommerce and ads</i>). 
            </p>
            <p>
                &#11088; Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines
                keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine
                guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.
